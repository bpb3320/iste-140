    <p>Greetings!</p>
    <p>This course homepage will serve as a record and directory for archiving and viewing all of the webpages I will develop over the course of ISTE-140 this semester! While this page may start a little barebones, it will slowly be built out with new projects encompassing modern web technologies like JavaScript, CSS, and more advanced HTML techniques. Feel free to stick around and enjoy the web development process with me!</p>
    <p>Cheers! -Ben</p>
